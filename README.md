### Design Support Library Sample

This app demonstrates very basic usage of the [Design Support Library](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2015/05/android-design-support-library.html). It's not fully featured, but it serves as a decent starting point.

#### Components Included
* CoordinatorLayout
* Snackbar
* TextInputLayout
* FloatingActionButton
* AppBarLayout
* CollapsingToolbarLayout
* NavigationView
* TabLayout

__Note:__ This currently uses v22.2.1 of the various support libraries due to bugs introduced in v23.0.0, such as a crash when dismissing a Snackbar.
